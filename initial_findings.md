(i) A 200-300 word explanation of the expected performance of the model in terms of mean
squared error and the key features driving the team’s modeling performance.

- While looking for the mean square errors in the model, we did a mean sqaure error for linear regression which we got 4529358.208464365 and we did another mean square error for random forest regressor and got 3690651.8474690663 and from there we concluded to use random forest regressor since it got a closer mean to 0. The key features we driving our team's modeling performance are the following: bathroom, bedrooms, number of schools in the area, the number of parks in the area, the five boroughs, floor count, floor numbers, 'has_childrens_playroom', 'has_pool', 'has_concierge', 'has_garage', 'has_gym', 'is_furnished','allows_pets'. 

(ii) A 200-300 word summary outlining the team’s intended strategy to improve the predictions
for the final round.

- We can improve our predictions for the final round by ___
