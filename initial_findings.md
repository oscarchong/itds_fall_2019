(i) A 200-300 word explanation of the expected performance of the model in terms of mean
squared error and the key features driving the team’s modeling performance.

- While looking for the mean square errors in the model, we did a mean sqaure error for linear regression which we got 4529358.208464365 and we did another mean square error for random forest regressor and got 3690651.8474690663 and from there we concluded to use random forest regressor since it got a closer mean to 0. The key features we driving our team's modeling performance are the following: bathroom, bedrooms, number of schools in the area, the number of parks in the area, the five boroughs, floor count, floor numbers, 'has_childrens_playroom', 'has_pool', 'has_concierge', 'has_garage', 'has_gym', 'is_furnished','allows_pets'. 

(ii) A 200-300 word summary outlining the team’s intended strategy to improve the predictions
for the final round.

-  Our team intends to improve the predictions for the final round by adding another feature with crime data from different neighborhoods. We will be using data of all the felonies from 2017 and 2018. We will create a circumference with a one mile radius around each rental, then will calculate the amount of crimes for each mile around the rentals. This way we can have a “number of felony crimes per mile” feature. Our assumption is that the rent in places with more felonies happening nearby will most likely be less compared to places with little to no felonies. We are also trying to use sentiment analysis on the description column to see if that might help us make a better prediction. We will also fix issues around false values and outliers for the size square footage, bathrooms, and bedroom features as some properties have zero bathrooms, zero squared feet, or ten-thousand squared feet size.
